# Chicken Out

## The story

Brenda lives at Mr. Roberts farm. Not aware of the activities outside the chicken coop, she lives her life in peace with the other ocupants.

One day a storm breaks loose, the heavy wind storm almost destroys the chicken coop. The chickens have their first peak at the outside world. Until then life outside the coop didn't even exist. When the chickens realise the outside world isn't sunshine and rainbows, they panic.

> Complete chaos.

> All the noise wakes the farmer up. He looks at Brenda.

> Brenda looks back.

The farmer comes running at Brenda with a giant ax. **Brenda runs for her life...**

## The game

### Objective

Chicken Out is a 2D platform escape game. As a player you control the chicken. The chicken is running away from the angry farmer and has to avoid obstacles on its way out. It is your job as a player to avoid the obstacles and get as far as possible.

### Mechanics

**Controls**

- As a player you can press the jump button to jump.

**Obstacles**

While running away you come across obstacles you need to avoid. There's 2 kinds of obstacles.

- Grounded obstacles: fences you have to jump over.
- Flying obstacles: chicken infused hay bales that can spawn at certain fixed heights.

**Lives**

Your lives will be represented by feathers.

At the start of each round you get 3 lives. When you hit an obstacle you lose 1 life. Every time you lose a life, the farmer gets a little closer to catching you, in game he will come closer to you. When you have lost all your lives, the farmer catches you and game is over. The game over screen is shown. Your lives are shown while playing so you don't have to keep track of them yourselves.

**Power Ups**

While playing the game a power up might spawn between the obstacles. There's 2 different power ups.

- Ghost chicken: gives you immortality for a short time.
- Steroids: gives you the ability to jump higher for a short time.

**Score**

Your score equals to the distance you run. The longer you run, the higher your score will be at the end of the game. It is visible and counting live while playing and when the game is over your score will be displayed there.

## Minimum Viable Product

A canvas is loaded which renders a circular object with a fixed x position. This is the player. You're able to 'jump' using a key on the keyboard. Also there will be grounded objects spawning that move towards the player. There will be collision detection between the player and the obstacles. You have three lives at the start of each game, when you hit an obstacle, then you lose one life. When you have none left, the game is over. Your score will be shown during the game.

## Our goal

Chicken Out aims to let you experience the thrill of escaping from an angry farmer. Also we want to raise awereness that there's angry farmers out there. Watch out, little chicks.
